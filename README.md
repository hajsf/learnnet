Inspired by [https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46) and started as a fork of [https://github.com/dvf/blockchain](https://github.com/dvf/blockchain)

For my own learning purposes, but could be fun to stand it up somewhere publicly and make it a blockchain learning experiment for others... more to come.

Shows example of  
- Simple web server for API (Rocket)
- Client HTTP using reqwest crate
- Serde serialization and deserialization
- Command-line parsing

### Dependenies
- [Rust nightly](https://rustup.rs/)
- [optional] [Just](https://crates.io/crates/just) (rust make-like command runner)  

### Build
`just build`

### Test
`just test`

Then, use Postman or similar to interact.
